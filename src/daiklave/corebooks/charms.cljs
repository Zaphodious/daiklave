This Charm represents an array of mechanical benefits: the Solar may perform difficulty 2 or 3 sight-based actions without a roll. She gains an additional two dice to notice hidden persons or devices, to catch sleight of hand and see through disguises. In dim conditions, she sees as well as in broad daylight. Deeper visual hindrances such as dense smoke or fog represent less of a struggle: reduce the difficulty of seeing in such conditions by 1, and remove the -1 penalty to detect hidden threats in such environments. These effects reflect the Exalt’s ability to notice and process hundreds of minute details, as well as to focus and manage light sources more effectively. The Solar’s visual range is also increased: she can see tiny details at 100 yards, quickly count masses of troops, and notice threats well in advance of her position. Special activation rules: The player may choose to activate Keen Sight Technique by paying six motes, one willpower. Doing so sets the duration of this Charm to Indefinite. Despite being Simple type Charms, each Keen (Sense) Technique can be activated simultaneously by paying the full cost of each. In addition, these Charms are compatible with Sensory Acuity Prana as well as with each other.",

   {:description "The Exalt’s senses of taste and smell are capable of flawless identification of flavors, textures, and scent profiles. This Charm represents an array of mechanical benefits,
                as well as two distinct functions of the senses taste and smell. The Solar can recognize an individual by scent alone, and she can tell older scents from new ones, enabling her to tell how recently an individual was present. Add +2 successes to Survival rolls to hunt for food, track a character, or find water, using her sense of smell. This Charm automatically extends the range of these actions to (Essence * 200) yards. This Charm also creates a library of scents which your character can reference. Upon learning this Charm, the library is populated with the scents of any Major or Defining Intimacy the character may have, but it can also include scents outside the confines of intimacies if the Storyteller deems them reasonable, including any scent the character has encountered in the last 24 hours, the smell of a favorite food or drink, or scents linked to strong memories such as love or pain. Entries in a Solar’s scent library can be used to aid in Investigation and Survival rolls, as well as in the smell-based Awareness Charms further up the tree. This Charm also creates a taste index. Similar to the scent library, the taste index allows the Exalt to immediately recognize any taste she has experienced within the realm of reason. The Solar can identify obscure, complex, or similar flavors and she can deconstruct a meal she has eaten to its basic ingredients, so long as she has experienced most of the flavors at some point in time. The taste index isn’t populated the same way as the scent library; most characters do not have Major or Defining intimacies for flavors. Rather, the Solar may perfectly recognize any flavor the Storyteller considers reasonable. If the character has been a master chef all of her life, her palate is going to be considerably more robust than that of an islander with little contact with the outside world. Conversely, those who have lived or traveled in remote locations may have had access to rare and exotic food, drink, and poison.

For any unknown, she can further make generally accurate discernments about what kind of being each scent belongs to. Beasts, for example, smell different than humans, as do the undead and spirits. If a scent is not in her library, she can still form a general idea about the creature it belongs to.

She can listen clearly to conversations through thick stone walls, hear creatures burrowing in the ground, ants marching on the branches above her head, and other, similar feats. For many actions that would require success on a roll at difficulty 2, the Solar can succeed without a roll. For more difficult actions, the difficulty is lowered by 1, and the Solar gains one automatic success. If she has a specialty that can be logically applied to the roll, the difficulty drops to 1. For example, a Solar who is unfamiliar with art crime will find it more difficult to identify a faked painting by touch than a Solar with an Investigation specialty in detecting forgeries.

This Charm is activated after a successful decisive Brawl attack. If the damage roll generates at least one success, the target is knocked prone by the force of the blow, and loses a point of Initiative, which is added to the Solar’s base value (typically 3) when her Initiative resets. This blow strikes with the force of a hurricane condensed into the Solar’s fist. The more damaging the blow, the more forcefully her opponent will be knocked away from her: For at least three successes, the opponent is lifted and bodily hurled into an object or surface within close range, hitting it with an impact equivalent to falling a short distance (see falling damage, p. 232), destroying any less-obdurate objects he collides with, such as wooden furniture. At four or more successes, the foe is knocked into an object at close range with tremendous force, or is sent sailing a remarkable distance by the force of the blow. If the former, the opponent hits a surface with force sufficient to leave cracks in a stone wall, impacting with a surface as if he had fallen from a medium distance. If the latter, the force of the blow throws him to short range with a short-distance falling impact. At five or more successes, the foe is thrown to short range and suffers an impact like falling from a medium height. The Solar can use Heaven Thunder Hammer to knock her opponent into a high ceiling, forcing him to contend with falling damage on the way down. She might also choose to smash him through a weak point in a nearby wall, causing him to suffer a collapse. She might aim to hurl her opponent into a spike protruding from a surface, turning the damage lethal, or knock her enemy from a rooftop, causing him to suffer a fall from a much greater distance. The player should include the environment in their stunts to enhance this Charm’s effectiveness. At Essence 3+, double the successes for determining the distance the victim is hurled. At 7+, the victim can be hurled to medium range with a medium height impact.",

This mark is painless and inflicts no damage, but instigates the immediate release of the captive, knocking him prone. So marked, the victim is subject to the Solar’s immediate grasp—when she is in close range of the mark, she may reflexively release the motes committed to the Charm, pulling the opponent back into the clinch. There is no grapple roll, nor a roll to reestablish control; the Exalt resumes control over the captive with the number of rounds of control she had when she branded him. If the Solar does not invoke this power, the brand fades away at the end of the scene and the motes return to her Essence pool. Removing the brand requires that the marked character succeed at a grapple with the Solar and wins at least as many rounds of control as those associated with the brand.",

When the Exalt uses Lightning Strikes Twice after using one of the prerequisites to unleash a decisive attack, her Initiative does not roll over until after the extra attack has been completed. Making this attack has slightly different effects depending on whether the Charm was triggered with Crashing Wave Throw or Heaven Thunder Hammer: Crashing Wave Throw: The Solar strikes her opponent after he bounces off a hard surface and take damage from Crashing Wave Throw. If the Exalt uses this version of Lightning Strikes Twice, she may meet her falling opponent in the air and make a grapple attack with his Defense set to 0. Succeeding in the roll for clinch control means the Solar must make an immediate throw or slam, hurling her opponent into further hard surfaces or driving him bodily into the ground. Heaven Thunder Hammer: The Solar must knock her foe to short or medium range on the attack in order to use this Charm. Doing so allows her to flash in to range before he impacts, cancelling his impact with scenery to strike him again. In this case, the Solar cannot grapple her opponent, but makes a strike against him as if it were a surprise attack. Using Lightning Strikes Twice counts as the Exalt’s movement action, but note that it’s possible to move several range bands while chaining multiple uses of this Charm.
