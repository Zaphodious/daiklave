Righteous heroes find themselves cast as vicious bullies when they fight a student of the Black Clawâeven when she starts the fight. Open Palm Caress can be used whenever the martial artist rolls Join Battle. As long as at least one enemy received more successes on the roll than the martial artist did, he and his allies are seen as having initiated hostilities, regardless of how the fight actually began. This applies both to any bystanders to the fight and to the enemies themselves, who might suddenly find themselves confused as to why they are attacking the Black Claw stylist. Characters may see through this deception with a reflexive read intentions roll against the martial artistâs Guile. The Black Claw stylist gains a single point of Initiative for each opponent or bystander who was fooled by this ruse, up to a maximum of her Manipulation. \n\n Mastery: The martial artistâs performance is so convincing that if she uses her first turn to make a clinch or decisive attack against an enemy who beat her Join Battle and failed to overcome her Guile, she may pay a point of Willpower to treat that attack as an ambush."}]}]}})
